How to Run
To train your own model, edit the Sentiment_Analysis.py file with your dataset path and run it. This will save the model in the saved_model folder.
To use our model, skip the training step and use the files in the saved_model folder.
To create a tokenizer for the model, run the Tokenizer.py file with your model path.
To connect the model with the front end, run the Sentiment_Analysis_Server.py file and update the script.js file with the server address.
To test the model on a web page, open the index.html file with a live server.
